# Dynamic Routing in Serverless Microserice with Vert.x Event Bus

## Serverless Framework
- 1 Lambda Function == 1 Microservice
  - For example, if you were building a User Microservice with basic CRUD functionality, you should implement CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE in a single Lambda function. In the code, you should resolve the desired action by inspecting the request or the context.

## Vert.x
- a rock-solid and lightweight toolkit for building reactive, highly performant, event-driven and non-blocking applications
- Vert.x Event Bus
  - allows different parts of your application to communicate with each other via event messages. It supports publish/subscribe, point to point, and request-response messaging.
